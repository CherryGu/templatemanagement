All Projects Must Have README.md
========================

All projects, some diretories should have a README.md to help explain what the project is about.

We also encourage all users try to write Wiki in this system.
[Go to Wiki on this GitLab site:](http://toyhouse.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn:8000/benkoo/projecttemplate/wikis/home)
（请用GitLab自带的维基系统，用以记录整个项目的各项内容。）

The Syntax of .md files 
-----------------------
The ".md" file postfix is short for  "Mark Down". The tuorial for how to write Mark Down can be found [here](http://toyhouse.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn:8000/help/markdown#toc_3):



Hyperlinking to relevant documetation
-----------------------
This file should contain sufficient information linking to various information and rubrics.

For example, I would suggestion not to use Chinese words for file name and directory names. Partially due to the fact that
it would be harder for users to see what has been changed for systems that cannot display Chinese.

尽可能不要用中文做文档或文件夹的名称。
